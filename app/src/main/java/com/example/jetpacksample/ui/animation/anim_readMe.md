# Animation and Transition
In order to have a thorough knowledge of Animation, we should know some of the important XML attributes that can be used in your application to have a perfect Animation. Some of these attributes are:

## android:duration:
It is used to specify the duration of animation i.e. how long a particular Animation will continue.
## android:interpolator:
It is used to define the rate of change of Animation i.e. how fast a particular UI will change to another UI.
## android:startOffset:
When you are having a number of animations one after the other, then you have to specify some time to a particular animation and that animation will wait for that duration and after that, it will start.
## android:repeatMode:
This is used to repeat a particular animation.
## android:repeatCount:
This is used to specify the repeat count of a particular animation. You can set the repeat count of an animation to be infinite, if you want infinite repetition.
